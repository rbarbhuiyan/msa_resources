\section{Mission, Aims, and Objectives}

\subsection{Mission Statement}
The ISoc strives to promote the teachings of the Qur'an\footnote{The Holy Book of Muslims.} and Sunnah\footnote{The way of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him/PBUH).}, and cater for its members to fulfil their obligations (according to Islam\footnote{The religion of Muslims -- a body of beliefs/principles said to have been ``completed'' for us (mankind) in the \nth{7} century (Common Era), with the fundamental belief that ``There is no god but the one true god, Allah, and that Muhammad (PBUH) is Allah's final messenger.'' also known as the Shahadah (``Declaration of Faith'').}) to Allah , as well as to facilitate their (and others') learning and understanding of Islam.

\subsection{Aims and Objectives}

\begin{displayquote}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item To strive to uphold the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah;
\item To facilitate a suitable place of worship where Muslim\footnote{A follower of Islam (somebody who sincerely professes the Shahadah, by definition, is considered a Muslim).} students, staff, Full Members, Associate Members, and non-Members can offer their five daily prayers (Salaah);
\item To organise and hold the Friday congregational prayer (Jumu'ah);
\item To make suitable arrangements for Ramadan\footnote{The ninth month of the lunar-based Islamic calendar, in which Muslims observe fasting.};
\item To make suitable arrangements for the two holy festivals of Islam -- Eid-ul-Fitr\footnote{The Festival of the Breaking of the Fast.} and Eid-ul-Adha\footnote{The Festival of the Sacrifice.};
\item To strengthen the unity of Muslims in ISoc (as well as at the University of Sussex and in the local area of Brighton \& Hove) and cater for their general wellbeing, via regular sporting and social events;
\item To promote and facilitate the educating of our members about Islam via regular talks, workshops, and education circles;
\item To promote and facilitate both understanding and dialogue between Muslims and non-Muslims via outreach, events (both independent and joint), an ``Islamic Awareness Week'' event, and participating at Students' Union events;
\item To encourage and facilitate the involvement of members in bettering the ISoc, the US, the local area of Brighton \& Hove, and society as a whole, via outreach and community volunteering;
\item To encourage and facilitate the involvement of members in the organisation and running of the society.
\end{enumerate}
\end{displayquote}

\section{Membership, Enrolment, and Withdrawals/Ejections}

\subsection{Membership Types}
ISoc permits three types of Membership (based on SU regulations):
\subsubsection{Ordinary Membership -- Subscribed to the ISoc mailing list, able to attend any and all University of Sussex-exclusive events, participate in official ISoc votes (such as the elections for a new ISoc committee at the Annual General Meeting or ratifying a new/amended constitution at an Open General Meeting), as well as run for all of the committee positions (including the Executive Committee positions [see the relevant section below], Treasurer, and Secretary);}
\label{subsubsec:membership}
\subsubsection{Associate Membership -- Subscribed to the ISoc mailing list, as well as able to attend any and all University of Sussex-exclusive events.}

Ordinary Membership does not require any registration fee i.e. joining ISoc is free. However, for Associate Membership, a fee may be required depending on the status of the Associate Member and according to SU policy and regulations i.e. non-students are required to pay (at the time of publication) \pounds 30, \pounds 15 for students/unwaged, whilst University of Brighton students may become Associate Members for free.

\subsection{Eligibility}
\subsubsection{All Students that are Full Members of the SU are eligible for Ordinary Membership;}
\subsubsection{All others (staff, students that aren't Full Members, Brighton students, and members of the general public) are eligible for Associate Membership.}

\subsection{Registration}
In order to become a member of ISoc:
\subsubsection{Ordinary Member candidates can join ISoc directly via the SU website (as is default for all SU societies);}
\subsubsection{All member candidates (including Ordinary Member candidates), who wish to join, can submit their name and email address to the Secretary, who will in turn submit the information to the SU's Societies Co-ordinator, who will then register the members themselves (in the appropriate category of ``Ordinary Members'' or ``Associate Members'').}

\section{Organisational Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
The ISoc Committee organisational structure is headed by a centralised authority, in the form of the Executive Committee (see \S\ref{sec:EC}), and is arranged as shown in the Fig. \ref{fig:structure}:

\tocless\invisiblesubsection{}
\setcounter{subsection}{0}

\subsubsection{The length of term for ISoc is from April to March of the following year, with a two-week transition period between the outgoing and incoming committee to take place at the start of each ISoc Committee's term, with an official Handover session i.e. the new ISoc committee will begin their term in April, but for the first two term-time weeks of their term, the previous ISoc committee is obliged to help the new committee with the transition, including the handover of any relevant documents/guidelines, contacts, financial accounts, as well completing and submitting the official SU Handover Form;}
\label{subsubsec:handover}
\subsubsection{Should any Committee Members (CMs) anticipate their absence from campus/the US for a duration i.e. travelling abroad, time off due to illness, etc., they should notify the President as soon as possible, so that sufficient cover may be arranged, as well as aid the President in this process;}
\subsubsection{That all Committee Members (CM) are to report to and check things with the President first before carrying out any action, unless it is within the remit of their Role (see relevant section below) or has been specified otherwise by the President;}
\subsubsection{The ISoc committee is a team -- the whole committee needs to work together as a team, and each CM (including the EC) should seek to support their fellow CMs and aid them in their efforts to uphold their responsibilities and better the society. That is to say that, if a particular CM is facing difficulties with their position (be it for reasons that are personal, financial, academic, social, etc.), other CMs should strive to aid them in their responsibilities without assuming authority of the effected CM i.e. if the Treasurer needs help with their role, whoever's helping should not make decisions without the Treasurer's approval;}
\subsubsection{Should CMs fail to uphold their official responsibilities/duties, or behave in a manner contrary to Islamic, US, and SU beliefs/policies whilst in an official capacity, that leads to discord within the Committee and hinders the ISoc in achieving its objectives:}
\begin{displayquote}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item They are to receive a verbal/written warning from the President (the President shall receive theirs from the VP) outlining said failings and suggesting solutions/improvements for the CM in question to implement;
\item Should such failings persist after the aforementioned warning, a tribunal is to be arranged comprising two of the EC and one other CM selected at random (all in the tribunal must not be the CM in question), to decide whether or not the CM in question is to remain on the committee or not, after which the necessary steps must be taken for either outcome i.e. if the CM in question remains, nothing is required, but if the CM in question is ejected, the now-vacant position must be advertised to the Society, with the Committee sharing its responsibilities under the lead of the President;
\item Whatever the outcome, and during the whole term-in-Office, CMs should not make the mistakes/failings of their fellow CMs public affairs that would lead to their public embarrassment/humiliation i.e. any disputes/failings amongst CMs should remain private and within the parties involved.
\end{enumerate}
\end{displayquote}

Note: Each Officer may convene their own sub-committees in relation to their stipulated roles, but will remain responsible for the function of their own Offices.

\caption{The ISoc Committee's Organisational Structure.}
\label{fig:structure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Executive Committee (EC)}
\label{sec:EC}

\subsubsection{The EC comprises the President, Vice President (VP), and Deputy Vice-President (DVP), and places the President as the primary authority within it, the VP as secondary, and the DVP as tertiary;}
\subsubsection{The VP or DVP will temporarily assume authority of the EC (and thus the ISoc committee) in the unavailability of the rank above them i.e. if the President is unavailable for whatever reason during some decision process or event, leadership will temporarily defer to the VP. As such, when the EC is referred to throughout this document, the same chain-of-command (President $>$ Vice President $>$ Deputy Vice President) is to be assumed i.e. ``check things with the EC first'' would mean to check things with the President first, and if the President is absent, then the Vice President, and so forth;}
\subsubsection{The EC should have \emph{at least} one male and one female member, and so this should be emphasised during advertisement of the aforementioned positions. As such, the highest-ranking member of the EC, for each of the sexes, shall also assume the secondary role and title of ``Brothers/Sisters' Representative'' i.e. if there is a female President, female VP, and male DVP, the President would also be the ``Sisters' Representative'', and the DVP the ``Brothers' Representative'' (see below for role details).}\label{subsec:equality}

\item If an amendment to the Constitution is sought by Members of ISoc outside the Committee, they must call an OGM (following the criteria set out in \S\ref{subsec:ogm} i.e. \emph{at least} 25 Members calling for the OGM with \emph{at least} ten days notice), and may bypass the first criteria i.e. the proposed amendment does not need to be voted in favour of within the ISoc Committee.
